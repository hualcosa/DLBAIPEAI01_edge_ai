### Due to Github's file size upload limitations, it is not possible to upload all the project files here. I have compressed all the files in a tar.gz format, and uploaded it to my google drive. You can download it from there, unzip it un run the app on your local machine.
Link to Google Drive zipped project files:

The compressed file contains:
 - Datasets used to evaluate the model
 - 20 final evaluation images
 - Model weights for each of the three pre-trained neural networks
 - tf-lite models
 - android application content
 - requirements.txt file to help you mirror my development environment
